## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup;
- CSS custom properties;
- Flexbox.

### What I learned

I learned how to use two images in background and positioned (positive value provided is correct view, negative - none. I don't understand whyðŸ˜¥).

```Code example
body {
  background-image:
    url(image-one.jpg),
    url(image-two.jpg);
  background-position:
    top right, /* this positions the first image */
    bottom left; /* this positions the second image */
  background-repeat:
    no-repeat; /* this applies to both images */
}
```

It was hard for meðŸ¤”. And I understood that design can be not perfectðŸ˜‘.
