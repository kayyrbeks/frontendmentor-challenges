## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup;
- CSS custom properties;
- Flexbox.

### What I learned

I learned how to position background image. Below you can see my code example.

```Code example
main::before {
  width: 100vw;
  min-height: 100vh;
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  background-image: url("./assets/images/pattern-background-desktop.svg");
  background-position: center 0;
  background-size: 100% 50%;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  z-index: -1;
}
```

I searched a long time how to position image with *background-size* and other background image propeties. It was difficult for me to understandðŸ¤”.
